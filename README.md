The Methodology selected for this project is the Scrum, to work on sprints and assign clear responsabilities to each department/team.
The repository contains Different diagrams to explain the functionality of the development.
We will be using SQL, since the data has specified relations, and it is more suitable for this project.
As a personal reflection, this project is helping to make clearer how the planning stage on a programming development should be approached, and to consider the most points possible to have a clear base to start working and develop from that point.
